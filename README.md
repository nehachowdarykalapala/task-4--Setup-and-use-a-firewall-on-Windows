# üîê Firewall Setup and Testing on Windows

## üìå Overview
This repository contains my work for **Task 4 ‚Äì Firewall Setup and Testing on Windows** as part of the Cyber Security Internship.  
The goal was to **configure, test, and document** Windows Firewall rules using **PowerShell** (and optional CMD testing).

---

## üõ† What I Did
- Enabled Windows Firewall on all profiles.
- Added an inbound rule to **block Telnet** (TCP port 23).
- Verified the block using `Test-NetConnection` and `telnet`.
- Removed the rule to restore default settings.
- Exported the firewall configuration for documentation.

---

## üì∑ Proof of Work
This repository includes:
- **Screenshots** of firewall rule creation and testing.
- **Commands used** (PowerShell & CMD).
- **Exported firewall configuration** file.
- **Detailed `report.md`** documenting the entire process.

## üíª Commands Used

**PowerShell**
```powershell
# Block inbound TCP port 23 (Telnet)
